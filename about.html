<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Who is Adirondack PC Sales & Service?  To start with we were originally under the name WebTronicLife.  WebTronicLife is the project by Russ Chatham Jr on January 14, 2000.  The company started out offering basic web designs and pc repairs.  As time went on the pc repairs turned into selling new pcs, then from there it grew again to on-site repairs and monthly maintenance. </p>

<p>At the same time the pc repair business was growing so was the web designing.  What started out as designing 5 sites per year turned into monthly maintenance and then when people complained about how expensive webhosting was, WebTronicLife began offering great hosting at an really low price. </p>

<p>As business grew, other services were offered such as print design, cloud backup, networking, software license management and so on.  It got to the point where the pc side of the business had to be itâ€™s own entity. </p>

<p>On January 2, 2014 Adirondack PC Sales & Service was started.   Once Adirondack PC Sales & Service was started more services and products were offered.  Our first goal was to establish ourselves with known name brands.  We are an Authorized Reseller for Cisco, NetGear, Lenovo, Samsung, Asus, Acer, HP, PointOS, Mad Katz, GigaByte, MSI, NVidia, AMD, Intel and Microsoft.  Our list keeps growing every week.</p>
